# dbc_pair_mate
This is a web app which allows DBC Phase0 students to schedule their paring by being able to view the list of available pairs and/or submit their own time slots.

Students should be able to create new accounts, view available time slots for their cohort/group, accept the ones that fit their availability or submit their own.
